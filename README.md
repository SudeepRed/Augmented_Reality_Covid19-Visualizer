## Concept:
  To visualize the covid19 data in Augmented Reality.

## Intent:
  My intent while developing this app was to display the Covid19 data in an interactive way which anyone could visualize.

## Goal:
  My goal was to develop a starting point for others to play around with different states of india and display various information. My project could be used to display state wise weather forecast or help kids identify different states of india by looking at them.
    
  This project can also be used to develop complex apps such to display airline flight trails from one state to another or display the wind currents over different states.

## Inspiration:
There was an instagram post by [Matthew Hallberg](https://www.instagram.com/matthewhallberg/?hl=en) where he showcases a [similar app](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-VeNQxDdIl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).
